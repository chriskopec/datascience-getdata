The run_analysis.R script contains a function run_analysis() that will generate the tidy data described in step 5. The dataset should be in the working directory in a directory called 'UCI HAR Dataset'. 

To produce the results described in step 5 perform the following steps: 
1. Load the run_analysis.R script 
2. data <- run_analysis() 
3. write.table(data, "run_analysis_results.txt", row.names = FALSE)
